# Public Repository Notice

This is the public version of my Rails Budget App. 

**Important Notes:**
- Transaction patterns have been replaced with generic examples
- No test data is included
- See `PRIVACY.md` for setup instructions

**For Development:**
The transaction pattern files (`lib/shared/transaction_category_patterns.rb` and `lib/shared/transaction_skip_patterns.rb`) are already set up with generic examples. 

**To customize for your bank/credit cards:**
1. Edit `lib/shared/transaction_category_patterns.rb` with merchant name to category mappings
2. Edit `lib/shared/transaction_skip_patterns.rb` with transactions to skip (ie: credit card payments)

**Original Repository:**
This public version is automatically generated from a private repository to ensure no personal financial data is exposed.
